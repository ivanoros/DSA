    //  Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

    //  Input: String= "araaci", K= 2
    //  Output: 4
    //  Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".

    //  Input: String= "araaci", K= 1
    //  Output: 2
    //  Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".

    //  Input: String= "cbbebi", K= 3
    //  Output: 5
    //  Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

            //  This problem follows the Sliding Window pattern and we can use a similar dynamic sliding window strategy
            //  as discussed in Smallest Subarray with a given sum. We can use a HashMap to remember the frequency of each character we have processed.

            //  1. First, we will insert characters from the beginning of the string until we have ‘K’ distinct characters in the HashMap.

            //  2. These characters will constitute our sliding window.
            //     We are asked to find the longest such window having no more than ‘K’ distinct characters.
            //     We will remember the length of this window as the longest window so far.

            //  3. After this, we will keep adding one character in the sliding window(i.e.slide the window ahead), in a stepwise fashion.

            //  4. In each step, we will try to shrink the window from the beginning if the count of distinct characters in the HashMap is larger than ‘K’.
            //     We will shrink the window until we have no more than ‘K’ distinct characters in the HashMap.
            //     This is needed as we intend to find the longest window.

            //  5. While shrinking, we’ll decrement the frequency of the character going out of the window and remove it from the HashMap if its frequency becomes zero.

            //  6. At the end of each step, we’ll check if the current window length is the longest so far, and if so, remember its length.


            //  Time Complexity #
            //  The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input string.
            //  The outer for loop runs for all characters and the inner while loop processes each character only once,
            //  therefore the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

            //  Space Complexity #
            //  The space complexity of the algorithm is O(K), as we will be storing a maximum of ‘K + 1’ characters in the HashMap.
